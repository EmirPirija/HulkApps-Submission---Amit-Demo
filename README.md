-HTML 
-CSS 
-JavaScript 
-Netlify for hosting (link: https://demo-amit.netlify.app/)
-Font Awesome Icons library

Approach to the Project: I approached this project with a focus on simplicity and user experience, utilizing React as the primary technology for building the webpage. I wanted to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing webpage that effectively conveys the content and purpose. In addition to React, I used HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling, and various JavaScript libraries and dependencies to enhance the functionality.
Dependencies Used:

-react-bootstrap: Version 2.9.0 
-react-dom: Version 18.2.0 
-react-responsive: Version 9.0.2 
-react-scripts: Version 5.0.1 
-fortawesome/fontawesome-free: "^6.4.2"
-fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core: "^6.4.2"
-fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons: "^6.4.2"
-fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: "^6.4.2"
-fortawesome/react-fontawesome: "^0.2.0"

What I Found Enjoyable: I found great satisfaction in the creative aspects of the project, especially when it came to designing the layout and implementing the design. I deliberately leaned more on React and its related dependencies, including React hooks, to create dynamic and interactive components. The project was strategically designed to reduce reliance on Bootstrap and make the most of React's capabilities, which greatly streamlined the development process, improved project functionality, and delivered a smooth user experience. Furthermore, I opted for plain CSS for styling, ensuring a refined and visually pleasing webpage.

Challenges Encountered: While working on the project, I did encounter some minor issues related to cross-browser compatibility, particularly on smaller screens. These challenges, however, were manageable, and in the future, I intend to allocate additional time for thorough testing and debugging.

Anticipated Completion Time: I estimated that this project took one day to complete, encompassing various stages such as planning, design, coding, debugging, testing, and deployment. This timeframe was primarily dedicated to fine-tuning the positioning of images and text elements on the page.

Known Issues:
-header section overlays by a bit on older phones and smaller screens 4.7'

Enhancements and Modifications:
The footer section
Webiste is fully responsive to smaller screens
Loading animation using React Hooks to let the user know the current state of the webpage
Buttons Interaction: Buttons are now active both on hover and click, providing a more engaging and responsive user experience.
Text Animations: Specific text elements in the header section feature a subtle pulse animation on hover, adding a touch of interactivity and engagement.
Header Follows Scrolling: The header now follows the user's scroll, ensuring it remains easily accessible as visitors navigate through the page.
These enhancements not only improve the webpage's usability but also add a layer of interactivity and engagement to enhance the user experience.
